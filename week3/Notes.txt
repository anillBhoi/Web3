As a user, You interact with the blockchain for two purposes
  1. To send a transaction 
  2. To fetch some details from the blockchain(balance etc)


In both of these, the way to interact with the blockchain is using JSON-RPC 
JSON RPC spec - https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification

There are Other ways to do RPC's like GRPC, TRPC 

An RPC server is not inherently part of the blockchain network itself, nor does it participate in staking or consensus mechanisms
     You can grab your own RPC server from one of many providers -

          2.Alchemy
          3.Helius

ETH ----> 

    Wei: 
       - Defination - Wei is the smallest unit of cryptocurrency in the Etherum network. it's similar to how a cent is to a doller.
       - Value - ! Ether (ETH) = 10^18 Wei.

    Gwei - 
        - Defination: A larger unit of Ether commonly used in the context of gas prices.
        - Conversion: 1 Ether = 10^9 Gwei


   Lamports 
       - in the Solana Blockchain, the smallest unit or currency is called a lamport. Just as wei is to 
         Ether in Ethereum, lamports are to SOL (the native token of Solana).

       - 1 SOL = 10^9 Lamports
