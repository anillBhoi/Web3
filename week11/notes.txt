# Impermanent Loss 

  ->  Whenever you create a pool/provide liquidity to a pool, you can end up losing money in the long/short term.

  What is Impermanent loss 
    ->  Impermanent loss refers to a situation where the compensation you recieve from allocating a token in a liquidity pool is 
        less than what you would have received just holding the asset.

        This happens when a tokens price changes in the market, causing your allocated assets in the liquidity pool to become worth
        less than their present value in the market.

        Let's say you deposit equal values of ETH and USDC into a liquidity pool:
         -  1 ETH worth $2000
         -  2000 USDC
         -  Total value : $4000
