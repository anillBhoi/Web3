What is Rust ? 

   Rust is a general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency.
    It was designed to provide memory safety without a traditional garbage collector, using a unique ownership model and
    a borrow checker to ensure that references do not outlive the data they refer to.
