What is a DEX ? 
-> A DEX (Decetralized Exchange) is a cryptocurrency trading platform that operates
without a central authority, allowing users to trade assets directly with one another (peer-to-peer) using smart contracts.


# DEX Vs CEX (centralize exchange)

 => DEX
 1.You have private key of your wallet 
 2.No one can censor you/take your assets (not true for centralized tokens like USDS)
 3.You have to do private key management yourself

 => CEX 
 1.You delegate your assests to a central entity.
 2.You dont have to do provite key management
 3.Govt can censor you, you have to KYC
 4.Exchange can get hacked 



 # CEX Jargon 

 1. Orderbooks - 
      - An Order book is a digital list that displays all buy and sell orders 
        placed by traders for a particular asset, such as cryptocurrencies, stocks.
        
        Example - Solana orderbook on Backpack exchange.



# How does a DEX work ?

 -> 1.Liquidity pools
    2. Constant product algorithm
    3.Automated market makers
    4.Impermanent loss
  

     1. Liquidity pools -> 
           - in the orderbook method, there are two types of people
               1.Askers - who have a lot of Sol
               2.Bidders - Who have a lot of USDC


      2. Constant product algorithm -> 
             - In Decentralized exchanges (DEXs), a constant product formula is the pricing algorithm used in Automated market makers (AMMs)

                 The Formula is : 
                     x * y = k
                     where, 
                       - x is the reserve of Token A.
                       - y is the reserve of Token B.
                       - k is a constant, meaning it does not change as trades are executed.



 # Slippage -> 
    slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade 
    and the actual price at which the trade is executed.

    It Occures due to - 
      1.Market Volatility
      2.Order Size
      3.Market Conditions - During periods of low trading volume or high demand for a specific asset, slippage is more likyly to occur.


      Slippage can be positive or negative: 
         - Positive Slippage: when a trade is executed at a better price than expected.
         - Negative Slippage : When a trade is executed at a worse price than expected




 # DEX Aggreagator -> 
      A DEX aggregater is a platform or protocol that sources liquidity from 
      multiple decentralized exchanges to provide users with the best possible price for their trades.    
      ex - Jupiter
