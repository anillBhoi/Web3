//Typscript being a syntactic superset means it shares the same
// base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.


// For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing 
// a string into a function that expects a number.
// JavaScript will not.


// Typscript uses compile time type checking.
// Which means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code.


// Typescript being converted into JavaScript means it runs anywhere that Javascript runs!
