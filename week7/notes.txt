System  program -> 

    Solana contains a small handfull of native programs that are part of the validator implementatation
    and provide various core functionalitites for the network.

    When developing custom programs on solana, you will commonly interact with two native programs, 
    the System Program and the BPF Loader.

    System program - 
        By default, all new accounts are owned by the System Program. The System Program performs several key tasks susch as :
            - new Account Creation: Only the System Program can create new accounts.
            - Space Allocation : Sets the byte capacity for the data field of each account.
            - Assign Program Ownership: Once the System Program creates an account. it can reassign the designated program Owner
                     to a differant program account. This is how custom programs take owenrship of new accounts created by the System Program.

                     On Solana, a wallet is simply an account owned by the system programs. The lamport balance of the wallet it the amount of SOL owned by  the account.




BPF Loader Program -> 

    The BPF Loader is the program designated as the "owner"
    of all other programs on the network, 
    excluding Native Programs. It is responsible for deploying, upgrading and executing custom progrms.



# Authority in Solana programs 

 -> In Solana programs, authorities are entities or accounts that have the right to perform certain
    actions or make changes within the program.
